READINGS

* I enjoy visualizations of things, and as I've mentioned before I'm particularly fond of maps, so a few of these projects jumped out at me immediately.

  * I looked at the pieces about the witches in Scotland, the Apostles, and the East-West exodus of Germans.
  
* I think what stands out to me most is efficiency. There's something convenient, and readily apparent about the way this information is presented that isn't always true of essays and articles.

PODCASTING

* Very much struggling to bring myself to do this task based on personal anxieties. Will return to later after the other tasks.

SONIFICATION

* Had a really hard time trying to find out what data to use. Used the provided example just to see what the process was.

* I made a .csv of all of the known Roman legions using data from a book that I own on the subject.

  * When I imported the file into TwoTone, it created something, but it didn't seem to read the data I used correctly.
  
  * I think this might relate to the dates I'm using (BCE and CE). I'll try converting to an easier to read AUC dating method.

* After a very (very) long time, I figured something out. I made a file with two sound patterns in it (Screenshot 1).

  * The bottom sound pattern is just there as a sort of timeline. The top sound pattern is where most of my focus was.
 
  * In it you can see the ebb and flow of Roman warfare. Legions get created in greater number in greater periods of war and unrest.
 
  * The spikes about a third of the way in show the vast quantities of legions created by Caesar and Augustus when taking over Rome.

* Something interesting I noted was how I had to present my data in my spreadsheet in order to get real results.

  * The soundbite I created was called 'roman-legions4,' giving an idea of the number of times I tried different spreadsheet structures.
  
  * I ended up settling on collating the number of legions per year because it created an audible pattern. My other attempts ended up in just a rising line, essentially what you see in the lower half of the screenshot.
