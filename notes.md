READINGS

* I enjoy visualizations of things, and as I've mentioned before I'm particularly fond of maps, so a few of these projects jumped out at me immediately.

  * I looked at the pieces about the witches in Scotland, the Apostles, and the East-West exodus of Germans.
  
* I think what stands out to me most is efficiency. There's something convenient, and readily apparent about the way this information is presented that isn't always true of essays and articles.

SONIFICATION

* Had a really hard time trying to find out what data to use. Used the provided example just to see what the process was.

* I made a .csv of all of the known Roman legions using data from a book that I own on the subject.

  * When I imported the file into TwoTone, it created something, but it didn't seem to read the data I used correctly.
  
  * I think this might relate to the dates I'm using (BCE and CE). I'll try converting to an easier to read AUC dating method.

* After a very (very) long time, I figured something out. I made a file with two sound patterns in it (Screenshot 1).

  * The bottom sound pattern is just there as a sort of timeline. The top sound pattern is where most of my focus was.
 
  * In it you can see the ebb and flow of Roman warfare. Legions get created in greater number in greater periods of war and unrest.
 
  * The spikes about a third of the way in show the vast quantities of legions created by Caesar and Augustus when taking over Rome.

* Something interesting I noted was how I had to present my data in my spreadsheet in order to get real results.

  * The soundbite I created was called 'roman-legions4,' giving an idea of the number of times I tried different spreadsheet structures.
  
  * I ended up settling on collating the number of legions per year because it created an audible pattern. My other attempts ended up in just a rising line, essentially what you see in the lower half of the screenshot.
  
  * I've uploaded a comparison between my beginning spreadsheet and ending spreadsheet, showing how I had to rework the data to create the final sonification pattern I ended up with (Screenshot 2).
  
STORYMAPS

* I enjoy making maps, so this was a relatively easy process for me. I knew a topic I wanted to cover, so although it was time consuming, making the map was easy and enjoyable enough.

LEAFLET

* In the command terminal I kept getting errors because I was putting in commands incorrectly. Getting rusty on the week 2 skills!

* It was very satisfying (and relieving) when I reloaded the demo webmap and everything worked as intended.

* Georectifying gave me some troubles. I chose a map of Ottawa, loaded up five different control points, and the whole thing just... broke.

* I tried it with a different image, of a different part of the city, and got it to work. Managed to get it into index.html with no issues, either.

* Success! All of the layers were added, including the animation, first try!

* I'm still very new to this, but I find that when following the instructions I can jump back and forth between certain sections of the code a bit more efficiently these days. I'm not as timid about getting it wrong, and I mostly get it right anyways!

POSTERS

* I'm struggling with typography. I understand the principles behind matching fonts and complementing each other, but I don't have the design skills to be able to know what works myself.

* I'm not fully sure of what step 17 is asking. I googled 'what matches well with Helvetica' since that is what the PDF uses, and I used a recommendation that I found on Google--Georgia.

* In terms of designing our an academic poster, I was struggling with the templates provided in the syllabus, so I decided to make my own from scratch.

  * Though this was time consuming, I got the layout to something more akin to what I wanted. I still took inspiration from the templates, working the information around a central image, but I made it into something that I felt represented my topic better.
  
  * I found the layouts provided too... small? Restricted? It felt like I was being confined to space I didn't want to use in the way it was presented, so I sort of recreated the concept in a manner more suited to what I intended to say.
  
STATIC WEBSITE

* I sincerely appreciate going through the first steps to see a resulting Napoleon Dynamite GIF. Made my night.

* I'm lost on how to go further, though. I think the wording (and the quantity of words!) in the instructions on Discord and the websites provided are overwhelming me.

* I've tried Youtube tutorials as well (I'm a better visual learner) but to no avail. I'm going to leave this here and return to it during Week 6.
